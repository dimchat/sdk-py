    Reset Group Command Processor
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    1. reset group members
    2. only group owner or assistant can reset group members

    3. specially, if the group members info lost,
       means you may not known who's the group owner immediately (and he may be not online),
       so we accept the new members-list temporary, and find out who is the owner,
       after that, we will send 'query' to the owner to get the newest members-list.
